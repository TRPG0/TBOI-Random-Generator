        <ul>
            <li>Changed the names of Tainted characters to be a slightly redder color to make them easier to tell apart at a glance</li>
            <li class="indent"><span class="material-icons">subdirectory_arrow_right</span> This is the same shade of red that is used in-game in the "Who am I?" text on the Tainted character select page</li>
